# Data files

There is currently no loader of Neuralynx data to python-readable output. We go through MATLAB as an intermediate and save those data files as a *.mat in this directory that can be read by Python. These files are ignored by `git` so they do not get committed to the repository.

It is possible to generate these files with the shortcut data and MATLAB code in code-matlab.
