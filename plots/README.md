# Plots from Shortcut analysis

This is where the output plots from the analyses will go. The files themselves are ignored by `git` so they do not get committed to the repository. 

It is possible to generate these files with the shortcut data and code in this repository.

In order to run the code as is, the structure of this repository should remain unchanged. This is because when saving plots, we give it this filepath to save into.
